Instruction for using the repository
====================================
a. LOCATION FOLDER: If you are participating from Zensar campus, your folders should be created under the top level directory Location_Zensar. Similarly, if you are participating from AMDOCS or Infosys campus, your folders should be created under the top level directory Location_AMDOCS or Location_Infosys respectively. These folders are created, you should use those.

b. TEAM NAME FOLDER: Under your LOCATION FOLDER, create a sub-folder with team name <Location>_AppTeam_<AAA>. You will get the number AAA from the Appathon registration Team. This number is unique and will be used to identify the Teams from the code/artifacts. Please make sure this number is reflected correctly.

Please contact the registration Team if you have any issue related to creation/access to folders as above.

Before you leave the App Hackathon venue, you will be required to upload your installables & code base artifacts in your TEAM NAME FOLDER only and verify with the registration Team. 

All the best!!!
