Instruction for using the repository
====================================
a. LOCATION FOLDER: If you are participating from Zensar campus, your folders should be created under the top level directory Location_Zensar. Similarly, if you are participating from AMDOCS or Infosys campus, your folders should be created under the top level directory Location_AMDOCS or Location_Infosys respectively. These folders are created, you should use those.
